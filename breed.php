            <p>Even within breeds there's enormous variety in the way a dog acts and reacts to the world around him. Those differences can be due to how much he was handled as a youngster, how well he was trained after bringing him home, and of course the genetic luck of the draw. In the end, your dog's preferences and personality are as individual as you are--and if you can accept that you're bound to enjoy each other.</p>

                <h3>Siberian Husky</h3>
                <p>The Siberian Husky is a medium-sized working dog, quick and light on his feet and free and graceful in action. His moderately compact and well furred body, erect ears and brush tail suggest his Northern heritage. His characteristic gait is smooth and seemingly effortless. He performs his original function in harness most capably, carrying a light load at a moderate speed over great distances. His body proportions and form reflect this basic balance of power, speed and endurance. </p>

                <h3>American Eskimo</h3>
                <p>The American Eskimo Dog, a loving companion dog, presents a picture of strength and agility, alertness and beauty. It is a small to medium-size Nordic type dog, always white, or white with biscuit cream. The American Eskimo Dog is compactly built and well balanced, with good substance, and an alert, smooth gait. </p>

                <h3>Appenzeller Sennenhunde</h3>
                <p>The Appenzeller originated as an all-around farm dog breed, who stayed busy herding the livestock, guarding the farm, and pulling carts in his native Switzerland. Today’s Appenzellers have still got the energy, smarts, and self-confidence that makes for valuable working dogs — but they’re anything but low-maintenance. Dogs of this breed need lots of exercise, training, and a job to do.

                <h3>Beagle</h3>
                <p>Small, compact, and hardy, Beagles are active companions for kids and adults alike. Canines in this dog breed are merry and fun loving, but being hounds, they can also be stubborn and require patient, creative training techniques. Their noses guide them through life, and they’re never happier than when following an interesting scent.

                <h3>Bolognese</h3>
                <p>A true companion dog, the Bolognese dog breed loves to be at his family’s side. However, he also loves getting his way and can be quite crafty about it, so be careful — you could find yourself being manipulated by a 10-pound furball. </p>

                <h3>Border Collie</h3>
                <p>The Border Collie dog breed was developed to gather and control sheep in the hilly border country between Scotland and England. He is known for his intense stare, or “eye,” with which he controls his flock. He’s a dog with unlimited energy, stamina, and working drive, all of which make him a premier herding dog; he’s still used today to herd sheep on farms and ranches around the world.</p>

                <h3>Bulldog</h3>
                <p>Bulldogs originally were used to drive cattle to market and to compete in a bloody sport called bullbaiting. Today, they’re gentle companions who love kids. A brief walk and a nap on the sofa is just this dog breed‘s speed.</p>

                <h3>Golden Retriever</h3>
                <p>The Golden Retriever is one of the most popular dog breeds in the U.S. The breed’s friendly, tolerant attitude makes him a fabulous family pet, and his intelligence makes him a highly capable working dog. Golden Retrievers excel at retrieving game for hunters, tracking, sniffing out drugs, and as therapy and assistance dogs. They’re also natural athletes, and do well in dog sports such as agility and competitive obedience.

                <h3>Samoyed</h3>
                <p>Originally bred to hunt, haul sledges, and herd reindeer, the Samoyed dog breed proved a valuable companion for northwestern Siberia’s Samoyede people. Among the breed’s duties: pack hiking, tracking, and warming their owners by sleeping on top of them at night. A working breed, the Samoyed can be strong-willed at times, but above all they remain friendly, gentle, and devoted family dogs.
